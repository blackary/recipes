To generate a markdown file for a recipe, follow these steps:

1. **Extract Information from the URL**: Visit the recipe URL and manually pull out the relevant details such as the title, ingredients, instructions, servings, and photo.
2. **Format Information**: Use the provided template to arrange the extracted information.

Since I can't directly access external URLs, I'll provide a hypothetical example based on a generic recipe template. If you provide specific details, I can customize the template further.
