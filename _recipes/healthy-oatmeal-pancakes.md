title: "Healthy Oatmeal Gluten Free Pancakes"
ingredients:
  - "1 1/2 cups (120 g) gluten free old-fashioned rolled oats"
  - "3/4 cup (6 fluid ounces) milk"
  - "1 large egg, at room temperature"
  - "1 medium-size ripe banana, peeled"
  - "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt"
  - "1 tablespoon honey"
  - "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
  - "1 teaspoon aluminum-free baking powder"
  - "1/2 teaspoon baking soda"
  - "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled"
instructions:
  - "In a medium-sized bowl, place the oats and milk, and stir to combine. Set it aside for about 5 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients."
  - "In a blender or food processor, place the egg, banana, salt, honey, vanilla, baking powder, and soda. Blend or process until smooth."
  - "Add the oat and milk mixture, and blend again until smooth, about another 1 minute."
  - "While the blender is still running, drizzle in the melted and cooled butter, and blend once more until smooth. The batter will be thick, but pourable."
  - "Heat a nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat and add a bit of butter or oil to coat the bottom."
  - "Pour or ladle the batter onto the hot skillet, forming rounds of about 4-inches in diameter."
  - "Allow to cook until bubbles break through the surface of the pancakes, and the edges are set (about 1-2 minutes). Flip and cook on the other side until lightly browned and cooked through, about another minute. Repeat with the remaining batter."
  - "Serve immediately or keep warm in a 200Â°F oven until ready to serve."
servings: 6 pancakes
