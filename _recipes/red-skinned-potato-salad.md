title: "Red-Skinned Potato Salad"
ingredients:
  - 2 pounds clean, scrubbed new red potatoes
  - 6 large eggs
  - 1 pound bacon
  - 1 onion, finely chopped
  - 1 stalk celery, finely chopped
  - 2 cups mayonnaise
  - salt and pepper to taste
instructions:
  - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to cool.
  - Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water; cool in ice water. Peel, then chop into small, bite-sized pieces.
  - Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, then crumble.
  - Chop cooled potatoes, leaving skin on. Add to a large bowl, along with eggs, bacon, onion, and celery. Stir in mayonnaise, salt, and pepper. Chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour before serving.
