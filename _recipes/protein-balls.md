## Protein Balls

A simple, kid-friendly, no-bake snack. Mix everything in a bowl and roll into balls. Keeps well in the fridge.

### Ingredients

- 1 cup oats  
- 1/2 cup peanut butter  
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips  
- 1/3 cup honey  
- 1 tablespoon chia seeds  
- 1 teaspoon vanilla  
- *(optional)* 1/2 cup ground flaxseed

### Instructions

1. Add all ingredients to a mixing bowl.  
2. Stir until the mixture is fully combined and sticky.  
3. Scoop out small portions and roll into balls (about 1–1.5 inches wide).  
4. Place on a tray or plate and chill for 20–30 minutes to firm up.  
5. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.

### Notes

- If the mixture feels too dry, add a little more peanut butter or honey.  
- If it feels too sticky, add a sprinkle of oats.  
- Mini chocolate chips work best for rolling.
