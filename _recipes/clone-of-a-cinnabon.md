ingredients:
  - 1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
  - 2 eggs, room temperature
  - 1/3 cup margarine, melted
  - 4.5 cups bread flour
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 0.5 cup white sugar
  - 2.5 teaspoons bread machine yeast
  - 1 cup brown sugar, packed
  - 2.5 tablespoons ground cinnamon
  - 1/3 cup butter, softened
  - 1.5 cups confectioners' sugar
  - 0.25 cup butter, softened
  - 1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
  - 0.5 teaspoon vanilla extract
  - 0.125 teaspoon salt
instructions:
  - "Prepare dough: Place milk, eggs, margarine, flour, salt, white sugar, and yeast in the pan of a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle; press Start."
  - "When dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover it with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes."
  - "Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a 16x21-inch rectangle."
  - "Prepare filling: Combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread softened butter over the dough, then sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over top."
  - "Starting at the longer end, roll up the dough; cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking pan. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes."
  - "Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)."
  - "Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes."
  - "While rolls are baking, prepare icing: Beat confectioners' sugar, butter, cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and salt until creamy."
  - "Spread icing on warm rolls before serving."

This Cinnabon recipe makes rolls just like the ones from the chain bakery. A bread machine makes mixing the dough a snap, and the rest is super-easy.
