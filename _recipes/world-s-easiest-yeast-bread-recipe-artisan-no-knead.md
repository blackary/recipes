title: "World's Easiest Yeast Bread recipe - Artisan, NO KNEAD"
ingredients:
  - "3 cups (450g) flour (, bread or plain/all purpose (Note 1))"
  - "2 tsp instant or rapid rise yeast ((Note 2 for normal / active dry yeast))"
  - "2 tsp cooking / kosher salt (, NOT table salt (Note 3))"
  - "1 1/2 cups (375 ml) very warm tap water (, NOT boiling or super hot (ie up to 55°C/130°F) (Note 4))"
  - "1 1/2 tbsp flour (, for dusting)"
instructions:
  - "Mix Dough: Mix flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl. Add water, then use the handle of a wooden spoon to mix until all the flour is incorporated. Dough will be wet and sloppy – not kneadable, but not runny like cake batter. Adjust with more water or flour if needed for right consistency (see video at 17 sec, Note 5)."
  - "Rise: Cover with cling wrap or plate, leave on counter for 2 - 3 hours until it doubles in volume, it’s wobbly like jelly and the top is bubbly (see video at 24 seconds). If after 1 hour it doesn’t seem to be rising, move it somewhere warmer (Note 6)."
  - "Optional – refrigerate for flavour development (Note 9): At this stage, you can either bake immediately (move onto Step 5) or refrigerate for up to 3 days."
  - "Take chill out of refrigerated dough – if you refrigerated dough per above, leave the bowl on the counter for 45 - 60 minutes while the oven is preheating. Cold dough does not rise as well."
  - "Preheat oven (Note 7) - Put dutch oven in oven with lid on (26cm/10\" or larger). Preheat to 230°C/450°F (220° fan) 30 minutes prior to baking. (Note 8 for no dutch oven)"
  - "Shape dough: Sprinkle work surface with 1 tbsp flour, scrape dough out of bowl. Sprinkle top with 1/2 tbsp flour."
  - "Using a dough scraper or anything of similar shape (cake server, large knife, spatula), fold the sides inwards (about 6 folds) to roughly form a roundish shape. Don’t be too meticulous here – you’re about to deform it, it’s more about deflating the bubbles in the dough and forming a shape you can move."
  - "Transfer to paper: Slide a large piece of parchment/baking paper (not wax paper) next to the dough, then flip the dough upside down onto the paper (ie seam side down, smooth side up). Slide/push it towards the middle, then reshape it into a round(ish) shape. Don't get too hung up about shape. In fact, lopsided = more ridges = more crunchy bits!"
  - "Dough in pot: Remove piping hot dutch oven from oven. Use paper to place dough into pot, place lid on."
  - "Bake 30 minutes covered, then 12 minutes uncovered or until deep golden and crispy."
  - "Cool on rack for 10 minutes before slicing."
