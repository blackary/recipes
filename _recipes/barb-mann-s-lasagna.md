title: "Barb Mann's Lasagna"
ingredients:
  - 1 Cup Flour
  - 1 lb. pkg. lasagna noodles
  - 2 lbs. ground beef
  - 12 oz. mozzarella cheese, cubed or grated
  - 8 oz. cheddar cheese, cubed or grated
  - 12 oz. ricotta cheese (I use cottage cheese)
  - 3-4 cups spaghetti sauce
instructions:
  - The only thing I think I changed was to put some sauce at the bottom (maybe 1/3 of the jar) and then put the other on the top (2/3 jar). You can always use some sauce in with the meat, too, if you'd like. And I put cheese on top, as well. Just don't forget to put the foil on when you bake it! (I did that the first time, and it was preeetty crunchy!)
  - Spread sauce over bottom of baking dish.  
  - Place a layer of noodles, a layer of gr. beef, cheeses, and spoonsful of cottage cheese.  
  - Repeat layer and top off with a final layer of noodles.  
  - Put sauce over the noodles and cover with foil.   
  - Bake 1 1/4 hours at 350 degrees.
  - (You can pre-cook the noodles but it works just fine to put them in uncooked.  It is best to let the casserole sit for about 15 minutes after baking before you serve it - it sets up a little during that time.)
