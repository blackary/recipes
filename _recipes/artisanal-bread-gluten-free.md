title: "Artisanal Bread – Gluten Free"
ingredients:
  - 2 teaspoons dry active yeast
  - 2 teaspoons sugar
  - 1½ cups warm water (105°F)
  - 1 tsp xanthan gum if your all purpose flour does not contain it
  - 3 cups gluten-free flour, plus more for dusting
  - 2 teaspoons kosher or fine sea salt
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
  - 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
instructions:
  - Place a Dutch oven with the lid on in the oven and preheat the oven to 450°F. (Keep the pot in the oven while the bread rises.)
  - Combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water in a medium size bowl and whisk to dissolve the sugar.
  - Let sit until it is foamy and doubled in size, 5-6 minutes.
  - Combine flour and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment (not the dough hook). Mix to combine.
  - Add the yeast mixture, olive oil, eggs, and vinegar and mix on low to combine.
  - Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl once.
  - Turn the mixer to high and mix for 3 minutes.
  - Place a piece of parchment paper in a bowl just large enough to fit into your dutch oven and dust it with flour, spray the paper.
  - Scrape the dough onto the parchment paper. Smooth over the top.
  - Cover with a bowl with a clean dish towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Cut 1-inch deep slits into the top of the dough to allow the steam to escape. Dust the top with a little flour.
  - Carefully remove the pot from the oven and remove the lid. Lift the parchment with the dough on it and lower into the pot.
  - Replace the lid and bake for 45 minutes.
  - Remove the lid and check to see if the loaf is nicely browned, if not allow to bake for another 10-15 minutes.
  - Lift out the paper with the bread on it and place on a wire rack to cool.
  - Note: If your all purpose gf flour does not contain xanthan gum add 1 tsp to the olive oil and mix, add to mixer after the eggs.
